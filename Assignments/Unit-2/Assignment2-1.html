	// Research and define the following Git related terms on an HTML or Word document.

	//1. version control software
		- Version Control Software tracks all the changes being made to the code to that date. Every upload or save of a file is tagged with a date
			and saved independently from the other files, so if a problem arrose in a later save of the same file, the developer teams can look back
			to see what was causing the problem by compairing the two codes.
	
	//2. add
		- 'git add [filename]' is used to save the selected [filename] to a staging area. This file is held in the staging area untill the command 'git commit'
			is used to move everything over at once if you used 'git add [filename]' on multiple other files, directorys or specific parts of a file.
	
	//3. commit
		- 'git commit' is used once you have items in the holding area collected by the 'git add [filename]' command. 'Git commit' will create a snapshot of your 
			files accompanied by some notation / documentation. Each commit is saved differnt than the other commits and can show a clear history on the working project.
	
	//4. push
		- 'git push' is used to upload all local commits (on your computer) to the described and intended remote branch or server.
	
	//5. pull
		-'git pull' updates your current local branches on your computer with all the recently added remote tracking branches.
	
	//6. clone
		-'git close' command is used to create a duplicate copy of a specific repository.
